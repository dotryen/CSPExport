# CSPExport
I wanted to make a mod in Yomi Hustle.
instead of getting aseprite i used CSP and turns out you cant batch export timelines in it.
this tool fixes that and automatically makes a Godot Sprite Frames collection.
It can also be easily adapted into any other format.

## Usage
### CLIP STUDIO PAINT EX IS REQUIRED

The script assumes that it is in the same directory where the CSP file is saved.
Modify the script and change variables to your liking.
Make sure all settings are set before hand (export shortcuts, export settings).
Exposure sheets must export to the XDTS format.
